# NASASpaceApp-Gaia
This project has the goal of collect real-time wildfires locations and searches into a database for historical similar problems and the weather conditions related to these wildfires. With these data becomes possible to analyze the events and catalog as "natural" or "criminal".
The database is formed by Nasa's history wildfire and Inpe (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais) weather conditions.
